## What is MatrixOne?
MatrixOne is a planet scale, cloud-edge native big data engine crafted for heterogeneous workloads. It provides an end-to-end data processing platform that is highly autonomous and easy to use, to empower users to store, manipulate, and analyze data across devices, edges, and clouds, with minimal operational overheads.

## Features

### Planet Scalability
MatrixOne cluster can easily expand capacity during SQL processing, computation, and storage, by adding nodes to the cluster on the fly.

### Cloud-Edge Native
Not limited to public clouds, hybrid clouds, on-premise servers, or smart devices, MatrixOne accommodates itself to myriads of infrastructure while still providing top services with low latency and high throughput.

### Hybrid Streaming, Transactional and Analytical Processing Engine
By converging multiple engines, MatrixOne can support hybrid streaming, transactional, and analytical workloads; with its pluggable architecture, MatrixOne allows for easy integration with third-party engines.

### High Availability
MatrixOne uses a RAFT-based consensus algorithm to provide fault tolerance in one zone. And a more advanced state-machine replication protocol is planned for the future to achieve geo-distributed active-active.

### Ease of Use
An important goal of MatrixOne is to make it easy for users to operate and manage data, making daily work almost effortless.
- **No Dependency**: Download, install, or start MatrixOne straightforwardly without depending on external toolings.
- **Simplify Administration**: Re-balancing, failover, system tuning, and other administrative tasks are fully automatic.
- **MySQL-compatible Syntax**: MatrixOne allows you to query data using traditional SQL queries.

### End-to-End Automated Data Science
By streaming SQL and user-defined functions, MatrixOne provides end-to-end data processing pipelines to deliver productive data science applications.
